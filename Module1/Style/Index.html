		<h2>I like to do things when I have no idea how to do them, 
		such as backpacking.</h2>
		
		
		<h2 style="color:red";> I like my hair,
		<h2 style="color:pink";> I think it's perfectly imperfect.</h2>
		
		
		<p style="color:pink"; Sometimes I want highlights, and sometimes I don't.>
		
		<p style="color: black"; I can play the piano, not well, but I can play it.
		
		<p>I like getting my nails done because it makes me happy. It's always the same color becuase it looks the best.
		
		<p>I make friends very easily and I think the backpacking trip made me outgoing.</p>
